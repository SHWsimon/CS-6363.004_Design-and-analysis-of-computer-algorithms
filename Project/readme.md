There are Code, Report (proof of correctness, RT analysis), Test report in this project.
	
	1. sxw173330Project6363.java - This file inputs the path of two raw data(in2-6363-2018s.txt, in3-6363-2018s.txt), preprocesses the data and then outputs it. There are several command-line argument - input G n(Gold, number of items), and i, wi, pi, ni, xi, fi, ci for each item.
	
	2. Report - There are 13 page of proof of correctness and running time in JPG files.
	
	3. Test report - This report shows the correct output of two raw data(in2-6363-2018s.txt,       in3-6363-2018s.txt).
