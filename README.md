* Divide and conquer: merge/quick sort, binary search
* Dynamic programming: rod cutting, matrix-chain multiplication, activity selection, knapsack, LCS, LMIS
* Greedy algorithms: activity selection, Huffman coding
* Graphs, DFS and its applications
* Minimum spanning trees: generic algorithm, implementation of Prim/Kruskal, disjoint sets
* Shortest paths: BFS, Bellman-Ford, DAG-shortest path, Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall
* Max-flow problem: Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp, Push/relabel, min-cost flow
* NP-completeness: introduction, reductions.
